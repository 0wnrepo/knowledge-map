# θ-notation


## def

### for a given function g(n), we denote by θ(g(n)) the *set of functions*

- ¹ within set notation, a colon means “such that.”

## notes

### θ-notation asymptotically bounds a function from above and below.


# O-notation


## def

### 

## notes

### When we have only an **asymptotic upper bound**, we use O-notation.

# 𝛀-notation


## def

### 

- informally, it means, "f(n) is at least as large as g(n), for large enough n, to within a constant factor"

## notes

### 𝛀-notation provides an **asymptotic lower bound**.
