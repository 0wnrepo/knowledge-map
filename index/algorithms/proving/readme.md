# [loop invariant](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Loop%20invariant)


## contains

### initialisation

- TRUE, prior to the first iteration of the loop

### maintenance

- TRUE, before each iteration and remains true after each iteration

### termination

- The condition at which the loop would terminate. After this, the final output of the algorithm will be arrived.

## notes

### In an algorithm, loop invariant is an intermediate step that holds each part of the final result and holds true for all the steps.
