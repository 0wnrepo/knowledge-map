# [floyd-warshall algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Warshall%20algorithm)


## desc

### is an [algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Algorithm) for finding [shortest paths](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shortest_path_problem) in a [weighted graph](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Weighted_graph) with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles)

### A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

# [what is an algorithm?](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Algorithm)


## Informally, an algorithm is defined as the computational procedure that takes a series of input sequence to produce an output sequence.


# notes


## mocking up the problem on paper is crucial

### just like writing the code to swap items in a linked list

### don‚Äôt have it all in your head

## even ‚Äúeasy‚Äù sorts like bubble sort get complicated with decrements, off-by-one errors, > vs >= as you try to avoid walking off the end of the array with a swap

## trees are good for almost anything as are Hash Tables

### the functionality of a Hash Table can be extrapolated and used to solve many problems at the cost of efficiency

## arrays can be used to back most higher level data structures

### sometimes a ‚Äúdata structure‚Äù is no more than some clever math for accessing locations in an array

## the choice of a language can be the difference between pulling your hair out, or sailing through, a problem

## the ASCII table and a 128 element array form an implicit hash table

## regular expressions solve a lot of problems

### but they can‚Äôt be used to parse HTML

- since it depends on matching the opening and the closing tag which is not possible regex

### regular expressions can only match regular languages

- but HTML is a context-free language

## sometimes the data structure is just as important as the algorithm
