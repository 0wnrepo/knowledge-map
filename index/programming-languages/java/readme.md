# notes


## java is strongly typed

### a variable‚Äôs type will never change

### when you convert String to Int for example

- it would typically create a new variable with the new type

- while the old one stays around


# basic data types


# how does java get compiled?


# interfaces


## a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. 

## Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method.

## You can use interfaces in Java as a way to achieve polymorphism.
