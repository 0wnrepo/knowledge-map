# notes


## UILabel and UIButton are subclasses of UIView thus I can call them where UIView parameter is expected

## _ symbol eliminates the keyword when you call the method

### essentially it means that you do not have to name the parameter when calling the method

### obj.methodName(button)  
    
  // no need for  
  obj.methodName(sender: button)

## Optional containing nothing will crash your program at runtime ‚ú®


# optionals


## The ? identifier means that the variable is optional, meaning its value can be nil.

### If you have a value in your code, declaring it as non-optional allows the compiler to check at build time if it has a chance to become nil.

### You can check whether it is nil in an if statement

# optionals


## You cannot send a message to an Optional without unwrapping it.

### Optionals them‚Äê selves don‚Äôt respond to any messages. (Well, they do respond to some messages, but very few, and you are unlikely to use them ‚Äî and in any case they are not the mes‚Äê sages to which the thing inside them responds.)

### If you try to send to an Optional a message intended for the thing inside it, you will get an error message from the com‚Äê piler:

## important use of Optionals is to defer initialisation of an instance property. If a variable (declared with var) is typed as an Optional, it has a value even if you don‚Äôt initialise it ‚Äî namely nil.

### That comes in very handy in situations where you know something will have a value, but not right away. A typical example in real-life iOS programming is an outlet, which is a reference to something in your interface such as a button:

### 

### you can reason about your problem in terms of the types and transformations of those types, before writing any code

- 

### don‚Äôt have state, have functions that return values

- although this is easier said than done

### higher order functions can be used to reduce duplication in code

### aim to write small, pure functions with no side effects

### avoid mixing pure and impure code

### aim to write small, obviously correct functions
