# where to begin?


## here I want to outline the different paths that one can take to learning anything, be it machine learning, web development, music or drawing, anything that you want to learn can be found in the mind map I made

## this is a work in progress and I hope you will contribute and improve on this mind map by creating issues and saying what you wish was changed or added


# physics


## basics

### [1. watch map of physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo&feature=youtu.be)

- this will give you an overview of how vast the field is and will spark your interest

### [2. khan academy physics](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics)

- watch the videos and work through the exercises, they are very important


# mathematics


## basics

### [1. watch map of mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y)

- this will give you an overview of how vast the field is and will spark your interest

### [2. khan academy math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)

- cover everything, fast forward videos as that may save time, just make sure to not lose on comprehension and rewatch or google phrases and parts that you donâ€™t understand

- do the exercises, they are very important


# web development


## basics

### [1. freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

- go from the beginning and work through all the exercises, they are really fun

## help

# machine learning


## basics

### 1. you need strong grounding in linear algebra and statistics

- for linear algebra

	- [1. essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

		- get an intuitive understanding of what linear algebra actually is before working with it

		- amazing set of videos, rewatch parts that you find confusing

	- [2. immersive linear math](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html)

		- amazing visual representation and interactive examples

	- [3. khan academy linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)

		- videos and exercises to supplement immersive linear math

- for statistics

	- [1. seeing theory](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/)
