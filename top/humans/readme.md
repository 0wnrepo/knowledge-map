## [Aldous Huxley (1894-1963) ‚ú®](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aldous%20Huxley)

### books

- brave new world

- island

### notes

- was teacher of George Orwell in French for a short while

### vid

- [Aldous Huxley on Technodictators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIgjujAI6eE)

	- Hitler used terror on one hand

		- brute force on the other

		- but he also used a very efficient form of propaganda

			- he had the radio which he used to the fullest extent

			- and was able to impose his will on an immense mass of people

			- despite german people being well educated

	- we must not be surprised by our own advancing technology

		- imagine a television which is saying essentially the same thing

		- it‚Äôs drumming in the single idea all the time

		- it is thus obviously an immensely powerful instrument

	- all technology is in itself morally neutral

		- these are just powers which can either be used well or ill

		- i.e. atomic energy

	- in his book Brave New World

		- we may have similar drugs which can change our mental state

		- if you want to preserve your power indefinitely, you have to get the consent of the ruled

			- and this they can do partly by drugs, partly by new techniques of propaganda 

			- they will do it by bypassing the sort of rational side of man and appealing to his subconscious and his deeper emotions

			- making him actually love his slavery

				- and this is the danger!

				- people may be in some ways, be happy, under the new regime

				- but they will be happy in situations where they oughtn‚Äôt to be happy

	- democracy depends on the individual voter making an intelligent and rational choice for what he regards as his enlightened self-interest in any given circumstance

		- what politicians can do however is to bypass the rational side of man, and to appeal directly to these unconscious forces below the surface, so that you are in a way making nonsense of the whole democratic procedure, which is based on conscious choice, on rational grounds

	- I still however believe in democracy

		- if we can make the best of the creative activities of the people at top

		- + those of the people on the bottom

# logic


## Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) ‚ú®

### was the first to formulate a precise set of Laws governing the rational part of the mind.

### He developed an informal system of syllogisms for proper reasoning, which in principle allowed one to gener¬≠ate conclusions mechanically, given initial premises.

## [Ramon Lull](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ramon_Llull)

### had the idea that useful reasoning could actually be carried out by a mechanical artifact.

## [Thomas Hobbes](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Thomas_Hobbes) (1588-1679)

### proposed that reasoning was like numerical computation, that "we add and subtract in our silent thoughts."

### In his 1651 book Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes suggested the idea of an "artificial animal," arguing "For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels."

## George Boole (185-1864)

### worked out the details of propositional, or Boolean, logic

## [Gottlob Frege (1848-1925)](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gottlob_Frege)

### extended Boole's logic to include objects and relations, creating the first¬≠-order logic that is used today

## [Alfred Tarski (1902-1983)](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alfred_Tarski)

### introduced a theory of reference that shows how to relate the objects in a logic to objects in the real world.


# politics


## [Joseph Goebbels](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joseph_Goebbels)

### was Reich Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945

### he was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes


# probability


## [Gerolamo Cardano (1501-1576)](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gerolamo_Cardano)

### first framed the idea of probability, describing it in tenns of the possible outcomes of gambling events.

## James Bernoulli (1654-1705)

## Pierre Laplace (1749-1827)

### advanced the theory and introduced new statistical meth¬≠ ods.

## Thomas Bayes (1702-1761)

### proposed a rule for updating probabilities in the light of new evidence.

### Bayes' rule underlies most modem approaches to uncertain reasoning in AI systems.


# physics


## Richard Feynman ‚ú®

## Heinrich Rudolph Hertz

### was first person to transmit and receive radio waves

## James Clerk Maxwell

## [Jacob Bekenstein](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jacob_Bekenstein)

### notes

- made fundamental contributions to the foundation of black hole thermodynamics and to other aspects of the connections between information and gravitation

## Albert Einstein ‚ú®

### notes

- it was found that individuals like Einstein have larger than average areas of the brain in charge of imaginative abilities. Likely enhancing Einstein's ability to imagine/stimulate complex phenomena.

- famously gained insights into light/physics/energy from literally imagining himself traveling along on a beam of light.


# polymath


## Leonardo da Vinci (1452-519) ‚ú®

### designed but did not build a me¬≠ chanical calculator; recent reconstructions have shown the design to be functional.


# philosophy


## [William Thompson](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/William_Thompson_(philosopher))

### RESEARCH: 

## [Francis Bacon](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Francis_Bacon)

## [John Locke](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Locke)

## [Carl Gustav Hempel](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carl_Gustav_Hempel)

### attempted to analyze the acquisition of knowl¬≠ edge from experience.

## [Rudolf Carnap](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rudolf_Carnap)

### Carnap's book The Logical Structure of the World (1928) defined an explicit computational procedure for extracting knowledge from elementary experiences.

### it was probably the first theory of mind as a computational process


# funny


## David Mitchell ‚ú®

### really funny man


# mathematics


## Kurt G√∂del ‚ú®

### showed that there exists an effective procedure to prove any true statement in the first-order logic of Frege and Russell, but that first-order logic could not capture the principle of mathematical induction needed to characterise the natural numbers.

### ln 1931, Godel showed that limits on deduction do exist.

### His incompleteness theorem showed that in any formal theory as strong as Peano arithmetic (the elementary theory of natural numbers), there are true statements that are undecidable in the sense that they have no proof within the theory.

- This fundamental result can also be interpreted as showing that some functions on the integers cannot be represented by an algorithm - that is, they cannot be computed.

## Alonso Church

## [Norbert Wiener](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Norbert_Wiener)

## David Hilbert

### books

- Geometry and the Imagination

## [Stephen Smale (1930-)](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stephen_Smale)

## Joan Birman

### notes

- went back to grad school in math in her forties, and is now one of the top researchers in knot theory

## Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass

## Rene Descartes (1596-1650)

### gave the first clear discussion of the distinction between mind and matter and of the problems that arise.

### One problem with a purely physical conception of the mind is that it seems to leave little room for free will: if the mind is governed entirely by physical laws, then it has no more free will than a rock "deciding" to fall toward the centre of the earth. Descartes was a strong advocate of the power **rationalism**

### Descartes was also a proponent of **dualism**.

- He held that there is a prut of the human mind (or soul or spirit) that is outside of nature, exempt from physical laws.

- Animals, on the other hand, did not possess this dual quality; they could be treated as machines.

### An alternative to dualism is materialism, which holds that the brain's operation according to the laws of physics constitutes the mind

- Free will is simply the way that the perception of available choices appears to the choosing entity.

# economics


## Adam Smith (1723-1790) ‚ú®

### science of economics got its start in 1776, when Scottish philosopher Adam Smith published An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations

### While the ancient Greeks and others had made contributions to economic thought, Smith was the first to treat it as a science, using the idea that economies can be thought of as consist¬≠ ing of individual agents maximising their own economic well-being.

- Most people think of economics as being about money, but economists will say that they are really studying how people make choices that lead to preferred outcomes.

- When McDonald's offers a hamburger for a dollar, they are asserting that they would prefer the dollar and hoping that customers will prefer the hamburger.

## [Leon Walras (1834-1910) ‚ú®](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/L%C3%A9on_Walras)

### mathematical treatment of "preferred outcomes" or utility was first finalised by him

## [Frank Ramsey](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Frank_P._Ramsey)

### RESEARCH: first order logic and his theorems

## [Oskar Morgenstern](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oskar_Morgenstern)

### wrote The Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour (1944)

## John D. Rockefeller

### notes

- He had a never ending frugalness, he counted every penny he ever spent. He did this from the very start and wrote it down. He was a very rich man yet his kids did not grow up as your typical rich kids. To the point of wearing hand me downs. He really had respect for money. Which is important specially if you don't have much

- He financed the founding of University of Chicago one of the most respected universities worldwide

- Never selling any of his stock in Standard Oil. That's why he became so rich. One of his brothers had a similar share of standard oil but he sold part of it over time so John D. was far wealthier that his brother because of it

- He started as a bookkeeper, no college

- He worked hard but made sure he rested. Short bursts of hard work followed by rest. Never worked on Sundays

# programming


## Bret Victor

### RESEARCH: 

## Rob Pike ‚ú®

## Robert Griesmier

## Ken Thompson ‚ú®

## Linus Torvalds ‚ú®

### desc

- created linux kernel

### vid

- [keynote: a conversation with linus torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efi9wa4Fwds)

	- the pace of development of kernel is really fast

	- the main pain point is people arguing over code

		- with the way kernel is developed, this problem goes away

	- it‚Äôs about trust and network

		- it‚Äôs taken 25 years to really get here

	- git was written to solve problems within kernel

	- problem of centralised models

		- it‚Äôs hard to trust a hosting company

		- the company becomes so critical

	- git is decentralised

	- Linus was maintainer for git for only 6 months

		- he came up with design but the big work was done after that by very awesome contributors

	- advantage of open source

		- nobody can say ‚Äòthis is the way to do it‚Äô

	- compare software development to biological evolution

		- it is not done by intelligent design

	- a lot of code never gets merged

	- innovation for the most part is **meaningless**

		- the most important part is **preservation**

		- get the **work done**

		- real work is in the **details**

		- Linus concentrates on **one project**

	- people who actually do the work

		- are the ones that you should listen to

	- conferences should be like that too

		- less about innovation and more about what work needs to be done and what problems do we currently have

### does cool things with graphics and math


# computer science


## Alan Turing (1912-1954) ‚ú®

### Incompleteness Theorem motivated Alan Turing to try to characterise exactly which functions are com¬≠putable -capable of being computed.

- This notion is actually slightly problematic because the notion of a computation or effective procedure really cannot be given a formal definition.

- However, the Church-Turing thesis, which states that the Turing machine (Turing, 1936) is capable of computing any computable function, is generally accepted as providing a sufficient definition.

- Turing also showed that there were some functions that no Turing machine can compute.

	- For example, no machine can tell in general whether a given program will return an answer on a given input or run forever.

## [Jens Palsberg](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/)

### professor at UCLA

### does interesting work on compilers

## Wilhelm Schickard (1592-1635)

### built first known calculating machine around year 1623

## Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)

### built a more famous calculating machine

### Pascal wrote that "the arithmetical machine produces effects which appear nearer to thought than all the actions of animals."

### In 1654, in a letter to Pierre Fermat showed how to pre¬≠dict the future of an unfinished gambling game and assign average payoffs to the gamblers.

## Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) ‚ú®

### built a mechanical device intended to carry out operations on concepts rather than numbers, but its scope was rather limited.

### Leibniz did surpass Pascal by building a calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, and take roots, whereas the Pascaline could only add and sub¬≠ tract.
