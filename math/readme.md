- it includes the study of :  
	- numbers (i.e. 3 + 6 = 9)  
	- structure (how things are organised) 		  
	- place (where things are and their arrangement) 	  
	- change (how things become different over time)  
- it uses logic, paper and calculator  
- a proof gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct  
- sometimes, math finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we don‚Äôt understand yet  
- studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better

### [incompleteness ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/BtnMKNwKjPpzdi7ryZwE4DhhbAoLqSpzcUuxfy4v#146.9,6.1,2)

- Godel‚Äôs incompleteness theorems are two theories of mathematical logic that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system containing basic arithmetic  
- the theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert‚Äôs program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible  
- the first implemented theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems ca be listed by an effective procedure (i.e. an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers  
	- for any such formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system  
- the second theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency

- probability theory is required to describe quantum phenomena

- [markov chains](https://my.mindnode.com/e3Hjd7WSfzApQaKjS13xx2iE1GHsgqniAaNgqscb)
  - are stochastic processes that satisfy the Markov property (sometimes characterised as ‚Äòmemorylessness‚Äô)  
  - a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process‚Äôs full history, hence independently from such history (i.e. conditional on the present state of the system, its future and paste states are independent)  
  - a Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either discrete state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies  
    
    
    
  is a model of some random process that happens over time, they are called this way because they follow a rule called the Markov property which states that whatever happens next in a process only depends on how it is right now (the state)

- is the process of deducing properties of an underlying distribution by analysis of data  
- inferential statistical analysis infers properties about a population (this includes testing hypotheses and deriving estimates)  
- it makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of sampling  
	- given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (firstly) selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data and (secondly) deducing propositions from the model

- in contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying ‚Äòsmoothly‚Äô, the objects studied in discrete math - such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic - do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values  
- discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers  
- more formally, discrete mathematics deals with countable sets (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers)  
- the set of objects studied in discrete math can be finite and infinite

### [combinatorics](https://my.mindnode.com/nt83Gi2tzRRpJgSTRGszs5PSgbnrxQzvoKQn7kfc)

	4. line coding

### [graph theory](https://my.mindnode.com/4qBQ8eA8wvpz6xBdDh1aoW3o9zxWxs1qKQXMqNB3)

- a graph is an abstract representation of a number of points that are connected by lines  
- each point is usually called a vertex (more than one are called vertices), and the lines are called edges  
- graphs are a tool for modelling relationships  
	- they are used to find answers to a number of problems

## [1940: category theory ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/1ZNruQzLV5bsrLYhY6VgsydH1r29YS1XgmeLKPaa)

- formalises mathematical structure and its concepts in terms of a collection of objects and of arrows (also called morphisms)  
- a category has two basic properties  
	1. the ability to compose the arrows associatively   
	2. and the existence of an identity arrow for each object  
- the language of category theory has been used to formalise concepts of other high-level abstractions such as sets, rings and groups  
- in category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself  
- it has practical applications in programming language theory, in particular for the study of monads in functional programming

- it the foundational place in the discipline of mathematics  
- it studies prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g. rational numbers) or defined as generalisations of the integers (e.g. algebraic integers)  
- integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry)

- are prime numbers greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself  
- a natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number  
	- for example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and and 6  
- any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering  
- the property of being prime is called primality  
- there are infinitely many primes

- is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing  
	- this can be studied by considering a collection of subsets, called open sets, that satisfy certain properties, turning the given set into what is known as a topological space  
	- important topological properties include connectedness and compactness  
- it developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension and transformation

### [1706: pi ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/Zgz1zspR7f7ZzcMaK2ggg47wx2xqTQPzivxjkqRq#3482.0,-260.3,0)

- is a mathematical constant   
- it is the ratio of a circle‚Äôs circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159  
- being an irrational number, œÄ cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction  
- fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate œÄ  
- the digits appear to be randomly distributed  
- the digit sequence of œÄ is conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness, but to date no proof of this has been discovered  
- it is a transcendental number, i.e. a number that is not the root of any non-zero polynomial having rational coefficients   
	- this transcendence of œÄ implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge

### [euclidean space](https://my.mindnode.com/tMaqSbrRYryARN3Lbs1tQQCq4NzziiyvRqv5xp5b)

- encompasses the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry and certain other spaces  
- Euclidean spaces also generalise to higher dimensions  
- from modern viewpoint, there is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension  
- one way to think of the Euclidean plane is a set of points satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angle  
	- for example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as motions) on the plane  
	- one is translation, which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance  
	- the other is rotation about a fixed point in the plane, in which every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same angle  
- one of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered equivalent (congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections

### [projective](https://my.mindnode.com/ZRPCoypbzsosstWfitcTsu5UP6EznRstHcdzsyaC)

- is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations  
	- this means, that compared to elementary geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts  
- the bass intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called ‚Äòpoints at infinity‚Äô) to Euclidean points, and vice versa

### [coordinate system](https://my.mindnode.com/X4AdwT6PXGEGaHZMayNXzVsgcwbxabnUZqqUWcHc)

- is a system which uses one ore more numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of a point or there geometric element on a manifold such as Euclidean space  
- the order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a letter, as in ‚Äòthe x-coordinate‚Äô  
- the coordinates are taken to be real numbers in elementary mathematics, but may be complex numbers or elements of a more abstract system such as a commutative ring  
- the use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and vice verse (this is the basis of analytic geometry)

- these theories are usually studied in the context of real and complex numbers and functions  
- analysis evolved from calculus, which involved the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis  
- analysis may be distinguished from geometry, however it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of nearness (a topological space) or specific distances between objects (a metric space)

### [real analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/c7re682pzFtTXzbNnqgdbXo1gPScsjSxZvMoTSWd)

### [harmonic analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/ZsWX3PEy41PXKmnB8nsi2hzpvuYH85HZKgBxYMCs)

- is concerned with the representation of functions or signals as the superposition of basic waves, and the study of and generalisation of the notions of Fourier series and Fourier transforms (i.e. an extended form of Fourier analysis)  
- Fourier series can be conveniently studied in the context of Hilbert spaces, which provide a connection between harmonic analysis and functional analysis

### [fourier analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/GTv2USZqpjKqq3yKJZHSsci1AgH66V9bTiXrFXR6)

- is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions  
- it grew from the study of Fourier series which shows that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer

### [numerical analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/gCqezFhjRQGcxfusZph2WMQstSCwWsJjqeNHxpPp)

- is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to general symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis 

### complex analysis

- investigates functions of complex numbers

- study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalisations of arithmetic operations  
- differential and integral calculus are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration

- [differential](https://my.mindnode.com/euvusRrywcxqy32QHBFDhARe17ZqadGnQLBNnDvK)
  - is concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change  
  - the primary objects of study in it are the derivative of a function, related notions such as the differentia, and their applications  
  - the derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value  
  	- the process of finding a derivative is called differentiation  
  - geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point  
  - for a real-valued function of a single real variable, the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best linear approximation to the function at that point  
  - differentiation has applications to nearly all quantitative disciplines  
  - derivates are frequently used to find the maxima and minima of a function  
  - equations involving derivatives are called differential equations and are fundamental in describing natural phenomena

- [integral](https://my.mindnode.com/XzzdBycWpX9FoRZgNGxDSkzNBy4v66Y44RZL4v6m)
  - an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that can describe displacement, are, volume and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data

- [multivariable](https://my.mindnode.com/yRg5BBtdfZm6hnwbvG74E6epJC1z5P7Kn4cvUUNx)
  - is the extension of calculus in one variable to calculus with functions of several variables  
  	- the differentiation and integration of functions involving multiple variables, rather than just one  
  - a study of limits and continuity yields many counter-intuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions  
  	- for example, there are scalar functions of two variables with points in their domain which give a particular limit when approached along any arbitrary line, yet give a different limit when approached along a parabola  
  - a partial derivative of a multivariable function is a derivative with respect to one variable with all other variables held constant

- vector calculus

## [1975: fractals ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/8suTHRqawXHqDPGAVYsxCAfbRQo6ZcGvCPvZ5vkp)

- is a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displayed at every scale  
- is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry  
- if the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern (i.e. Menger Sponge)  
	- fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels   
- they include the idea of a detailed pattern that repeats itself  
- they are different from other geometric figures because of the way in which they scale  
	- doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiples its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (here the dimension of the space the polygon resides in)  
	- likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight (to the power of its dimension)  
	- this power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal and it usually exceeds the fractal‚Äôs topological dimension  
- they are usually nowhere differentiable  
	- an infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line, still being a 1-dimensional line yet having a fractal dimension indication it also resembles a surface

- is the study of linear operators on function spaces, beginning with differential operators and integral operators  
	- the operators may be presented abstractly by their characteristics, such as bounded linear operators or closed operators, and consideration may be given to nonlinear operators  
- if a collection of operators forms an algebra over a field, then it is an operator algebra

	- axioms may be treated as conditions that must be met before the statement applies  
- they are examples of exhaustive deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning  
- a proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true (occasionally by listing all possible cases and showing that it holds in each), rather that enumerate many confirmatory cases
