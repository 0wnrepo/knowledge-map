## in normal mode

### vi(

- inside brackets, go to visual mode and select text inside the brackets

- where ( can be any other symbol

### va(

- inside brackets, go to visual mode and select text AND the brackets

## search and replace

### :%s/foo/bar/g

- in all lines

- find each occurrence of ‚Äòfoo‚Äô

- replace with bar

## gg=G

### will indent code

# terms


## text objects

### are blocks of text with a starting and ending point

### when you use a motion, conceive of that as an operation that is creating a dynamic text object that is delimited by the starting and ending cursor position

## [buffers](http://joshldavis.com/2014/04/05/vim-tab-madness-buffers-vs-tabs/)

### is text that you are editing

### i.e. when you open a file, the content of the file is loaded into a buffer


# macros


# normal mode


## (‚áß) shift mappings

### ‚áß + v

- visually select current line

	- then can move up and down with j k

	- ‚áß + v n j

		- visually select next n lines

	- ‚áß + v n k

		- visually select previous n lines

## commands

### d

- delete

- df<x>

	- delete until next x

- dF<x>

	- delete until previous x

- dt<x>

	- delete until x

### f

- f<char>

	- will go to next character

- F<char>

	- will go to previous character

## useful

### go to beginning of line

- 0

	- always moves the cursor to the "first column"

- can also use ‚áß + I

	- to move and switch to insert mode

## ^

### jump to start of line

## $

### jump to end of line

## G

### jump to end of file

### 2G

- jump to line 2

- where 2 is number of lines

## w

### go forward one word

## b

### go back one word

## x

### delete sign under cursor

## dd

### delete line

## d

### works like cut

## y

### yank = copy

## p

### paste

## Y

### copy line

## i

### insert mode at cursor position

## a

### insert mode at next cursor position

## A

### insert at the end of line

## o

### insert in next line

## O

### insert in before line

## H

### brings me to top of current window

## M

### brings me to the middle

## v

### go to visual mode

# visual mode


## v/foo

### will select from my current position to the next instance of ‚Äúfoo‚Äù

## V

### go to visual line mode (one line at a time)


# motions


## Motions are in most cases the second part of an entire command you want to execute when working with Vim.

## You apply them during the so called **Operator-Pending Mode**, which is the little time frame where you apply a "target" to built-in commands such as d, y or c.

## Let's say you want to delete from the current cursor position until the next occurrence of the letter r. You do that with the t command which brings your cursor in front of the next occurrence of the given characer. So typing dtr in Normal Mode could be read as Delete until next 'r'. The basic pattern of the d command is d{motion} and you can use any kind of motion there.


# text objects


## Text-objects can be used in context of motions.

## They are a bit more clever than normal motions because they can act in both "directions."

## For example, whereas the w command in Normal Mode is a motion to jump to the next word, iw is a text-object that operates inside the current word.

## Where "inside" means "this word excluding the surrounding spaces".

## So, to delete a word you can compose commands like diw or daw for around a word. 

## There are text-objects for paragraphs (ip, ap), sentences (is, as), HTML tags (it, at) and Vim is even smart enough to act on the current function block (i{, a{).
