# basics


## [1. read code: hidden language book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code)

- have to buy the book or search for pdf online  
- goes over what a computer actually is and what it is made of, starting from the beginning

## [2. read structure and interpretation of computer programs](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml)

- goes over what a computer actually is and what it is made of, starting from the beginning

## [3. build a computer from first principles course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

- will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer


# deeper


## math

- [1. mathematics for computer science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf)
  - goes over the mathematical foundation that you need to do research in this field

## algorithms

- [1. algorithms: part I course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
  - a really great course by Stanford university that introduces you to different algorithms  
  - how to prove them and reason about their efficiency

- [2. algorithms: part II course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
  - continuation of the above course

- [3. read introduction to algorithms book](http://ce.bonabu.ac.ir/uploads/30/CMS/user/file/115/EBook/Introduction.to.Algorithms.3rd.Edition.Sep.2010.pdf)
  - can be read alongside the above courses
