#mindmaps

I love mindmaps and started using them for everything, that is any kind of project that I want to make.

I am only starting on this idea of mind mapping **everything**. But here is the *beginning* of this journey.

Everything is sorted into their appropriate sections and the only requirement is to have [Mindnode](https://mindnode.com/) application to actually open these .mindnode files.
