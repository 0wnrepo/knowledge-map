- weekly workshop series at ITP to teach machine learning with a focus on deep learning


# basics

- not sure what the best way to start learning the topic is but these resources seem great  
	- if someone proficient in the field does have the time   
		- I would love to improve this


## [1. go through visual introduction to machine learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)

## [2. take cs231 course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA)

- [course notes](http://cs231n.github.io/)

## [2. coursera course on machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

- [lecture slides and notes](https://github.com/1094401996/machine-learning-coursera)

## [2. learning from data course](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html)

## [2. deep learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org)

- one of the best introductions to the field, assumes you have the mathematical background to follow it
