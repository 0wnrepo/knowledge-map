[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is extremely powerful tool that allows you to remember information by putting it into your long term memory using [spaced repetion learning](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spaced_repetition) technique. 

As time passes, it becomes unfeasible to really understand and process what is going on in this mind map. There are too many fields, too many topics, too many words and concepts you need to understand. That is why it is crucial to first understand how memory works and optimise for understanding and retention. There are few rules I follow before I put information into Anki for processing and memorisation. Here are these rules : 

1. I have to do a lot of research into the topic and the idea before marking it off for processing
	- I do not want to learn something **wrong**
2. Knowledge sent for processing has to be clear and unambiguous

With these rules I can effectively transfer the entirety of the mind map into my memory for processing. The goal isn't really to memorise the topics. It is to be exposed to them enough times so that I can remember these topics well enough and have a stronger base from which I can pull myself to make new connections and discoveries.

As with the original idea of this repository. I want to share all the knowledge that I have in a clear and discoverable way. We live in the world where all the knowledge of the world is available at our finger tips. You just have to know where to find it. I try to present the world view and all its connections as I see it. Take what I know and do your own research. Come to your own conclusions.

In this folder I will release all the decks that I have created to process this mind map into my long term memory. Here is how my Anki looks currently :

To use these decks all you need is the app itself which you can get [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for free.
