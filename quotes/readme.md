## Because you're only free if you refrain from touching the walls of your cell.

## It's all in your head. You just have no idea how big your head is.

### Lon Milo Duquette

## these are all just metaphors for something that simply cannot be put into words.

## People have lot invested in this ride.

### Bill Hicks

## When you change yourself you change the world.

## When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change,

### Jiddu Krishnamurti

## The ego is an enlightenment trap.

## Meditation is the medicine, mindfulness the diet.

## You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment

### Thoreau

## Lately it occurs to me, what a long strange trip it's been...

## [Could it be anything but perfect though?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/5pul1f/i_love_you_everything_is_perfect/)

## A man was walking along a river bank when he saw another man on the opposite side.

### "Hello!" he called out, "how do you get to the other side of the river?"

- The man called out in response, "you are on the other side of the river!"

## [Anxiety's a funny thing. A simple change in perspective and it's just gone. But will it stay gone? That's always the question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/5b9n3d/philosopher_alan_watts_short_lecture_on_letting_go/)

## We often look, but we rarely see.

## We often hear, but we rarely listen.

## I have seen this as well. It's called ego death.

### The past and future do not exist. Only the moment. And in the moment everything exists. Life... existence... reality itself raging forward. You are only random jumble of some matter from a random part of the universe. You are no more important than any other piece of reality. But in the same sense, you are the most important thing in the universe. You are the universe. The universe is within you and you within it.

### During ego death you realize this. This fact of existence. You are only another piece of matter. You are exactly the same as a table or chair or the dirt. You are simply matter. Conscious matter. A bunch of atoms with self awareness. Ego death is... in my opinion, the most tangible example of nirvana. It is the greatest form of understanding.

### We are all just lucky bundles of atoms experiencing existence together. It makes you chill out and have empathy for other life forms.

### We just exist. We are just alive. And we overcomplicate it all. But all life forms have the same basic feelings about stuff.

## We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you‚Äôre dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

## The universe is endless, limitless and infinite. Any effort to define it's boundaries is an attempt to overcome ignorance. We are physical, mental and spiritual beings ... there is no beginning and there is no end. There is only memory. Our repeated loss of memory experiences create the illusion of beginnings and ends. Immortality is the ability to retain full memory through all consciousness transformations. Loss of memory is man's greatest curse and, in very real terms, death.

## Let us declare nature to be legitimate. All plants should be declared legal, and all animals for that matter. The notion of illegal plants and animals is obnoxious and ridiculous.

## Modern man is a prisoner who thinks he is free because he refrains from touching the walls of his dungeon.

## You are an extra in everyone else's movie

### For most of the people you interact with you will only be a fleeting instance. A brief encounter. Something to be forgotten.

## [God is consciousness without the sense of self](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5rhm1j/what_does_god_mean_to_you/dd7dywq/)

## [After years of meditation, thousands of "out of body" experiences and one very significant, particular meditation I've come to the conclusion that I am not in the world, but the world is within "me".](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5swt7m/what_is_the_craziest_thought_you_believe_in/ddin787/)

## heaven, it's anywhere but where you are

## So then, let‚Äôs suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream, and that you could for example have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time, or any length of time you wanted to have.  
  And you would, naturally, as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure during your sleep. And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each you would say ‚ÄúWell that was pretty great‚Äù. But now let‚Äôs have a surprise, let‚Äôs have a dream which isn‚Äôt under control, where something is gonna happen to me that I don‚Äôt know what it's gonna be.  
  And you would dig that and would come out of that and you would say ‚ÄúWow that was a close shave, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù. Then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further- and further-out gambles what you would dream. And finally, you would dream where you are now. You would dream the dream of living the life that you are actually living today.  
  That would be within the infinite multiplicity of choices you would have. Of playing that you weren't god, because the whole nature of the godhead, according to this idea, is to play that he is not. So in this idea then, everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality, not god in a politically kingly sense, but god in the sense of being the self, the deep-down basic whatever there is. And you are all that, only you are pretending you are not. ‚ú®

## It's so fun to stop every now and then when writing a lambda fucntion and think it through all the way to the electrons hitting the monitor, etc.

## error driven development

## Wait, what? Why does my code depend on that?

### ancient Google proverb

## The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.

### Tom Cargill, Bell Labs

## The whole point of JavaScript libraries is to abstract away the browser‚Äôs internal API and provide a different, better API instead.

### Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

## For a long time it seemed to me that real life was about to begin, but there was always some obstacle in the way. Something had to be got through first, some unfinished business; time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.

### Alfred D. Souza

## I can remember thinking, "Oh, someday, like in my mid-thirties maybe, everything's going to just somehow gel and settle, just end." It was like there was this plateau, and it was waiting for me, and I was climbing up it, and when I got to the top, all growth and change would stop. Even exhilaration. But that hasn't happened like that, thank goodness. I think that what we don't take into account when we're young is our endless curiosity. That's what's so great about being human.

## Some people Instagram their food. On Hackernews, foodie cred is earned by bragging about what you don't eat. Sugar. Bread. Dairy. Meat. Caffeine. All of these are linked by science to early stroke, heart attack, cancer, and/or obesity. In addition, to live a long healthy life you need to tend to the bacteria living in your intestine like a Sea Monkey colony -- and don't forget to meditate frequently.

### Some people say that we have soulmates, not just one, but many. And that we meet again and again throughout our lives.

### Some people like to keep their minds on other things. And so they spend their whole lives looking for answers to the wrong questions. 

### But what if the many secrets of life and death  
  were not as unknown as we‚Äôve been taught to believe?

### Maybe, if you just shift your mind  
  ever so slightly   
  just an inch to the left  
  you‚Äôll see what I mean. 

### You‚Äôll know when it happens.   
  It will feel like a hundred sunsets hitting you all at once.

### It‚Äôs a difficult feeling to explain,

## What is special about atomic theory is the supposition that there is an endpoint to recursive reduction. That at some point you cannot find anything simpler.

## What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ‚Äúfailed to take into account man‚Äôs almost infinite appetite for distractions.‚Äù In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.

## DMT will not teach you anything about this universe. The only guaranteed truths you will find there are about the self. Everything else is just what could be, in my opinion.


# loneliness


## The self hides in many ways, under every stone, the self can hide in compassion, going to India and looking after poor people, because the self is attached to some idea, faith, conclusion, belief, which makes me compassionate because I love Jesus or Krishna, and I go up to heaven. The self has many masks, the mask of meditation, the mask of achieving the highest, the mask that I am enlightened, that ‚ÄúI know of what I speak.‚Äù All this concern about humanity is another mask. So one has to have an extraordinary, subtle, quick brain to see where it is hiding. It requires great attention, watching, watching, watching.
