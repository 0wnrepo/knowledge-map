## We often look, but we rarely see.

## We often hear, but we rarely listen.

## I have seen this as well. It's called ego death.

### The past and future do not exist. Only the moment. And in the moment everything exists. Life... existence... reality itself raging forward. You are only random jumble of some matter from a random part of the universe. You are no more important than any other piece of reality. But in the same sense, you are the most important thing in the universe. You are the universe. The universe is within you and you within it.

### During ego death you realize this. This fact of existence. You are only another piece of matter. You are exactly the same as a table or chair or the dirt. You are simply matter. Conscious matter. A bunch of atoms with self awareness. Ego death is... in my opinion, the most tangible example of nirvana. It is the greatest form of understanding.

### We are all just lucky bundles of atoms experiencing existence together. It makes you chill out and have empathy for other life forms.

### We just exist. We are just alive. And we overcomplicate it all. But all life forms have the same basic feelings about stuff.

## We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you‚Äôre dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

## The universe is endless, limitless and infinite. Any effort to define it's boundaries is an attempt to overcome ignorance. We are physical, mental and spiritual beings ... there is no beginning and there is no end. There is only memory. Our repeated loss of memory experiences create the illusion of beginnings and ends. Immortality is the ability to retain full memory through all consciousness transformations. Loss of memory is man's greatest curse and, in very real terms, death.

## Let us declare nature to be legitimate. All plants should be declared legal, and all animals for that matter. The notion of illegal plants and animals is obnoxious and ridiculous.

## Modern man is a prisoner who thinks he is free because he refrains from touching the walls of his dungeon.

## You are an extra in everyone else's movie

### For most of the people you interact with you will only be a fleeting instance. A brief encounter. Something to be forgotten.

## [God is consciousness without the sense of self](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5rhm1j/what_does_god_mean_to_you/dd7dywq/)

## [After years of meditation, thousands of "out of body" experiences and one very significant, particular meditation I've come to the conclusion that I am not in the world, but the world is within "me".](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5swt7m/what_is_the_craziest_thought_you_believe_in/ddin787/)

### Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

## For a long time it seemed to me that real life was about to begin, but there was always some obstacle in the way. Something had to be got through first, some unfinished business; time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.

## I can remember thinking, "Oh, someday, like in my mid-thirties maybe, everything's going to just somehow gel and settle, just end."

But that hasn't happened like that, thank goodness. I think that what we don't take into account when we're young is our endless curiosity. That's what's so great about being human.

## [Some people say that we‚Äôve been here before.That we don‚Äôt live just once, but hundreds of times. ](http://www.jamesreads.com/about/)

### Some people say that we have soulmates, not just one, but many. And that we meet again and again throughout our lives.

### Some people like to keep their minds on other things. And so they spend their whole lives looking for answers to the wrong questions. 

### But what if the many secrets of life and death  
  were not as unknown as we‚Äôve been taught to believe?

### Maybe, if you just shift your mind  
  ever so slightly   
  just an inch to the left  
  you‚Äôll see what I mean. 

### You‚Äôll know when it happens.   
  It will feel like a hundred sunsets hitting you all at once.

### It‚Äôs a difficult feeling to explain,  
  maybe you have felt it before.  
  It‚Äôs sort of like old friends meeting,  
  or the dawn breaking into the night  
  after a thousand years of darkness.

### But if I really told you the secrets of the universe,   
  you probably wouldn‚Äôt believe me.

### So I am here to remind you of how it used to be.  
  No longer just the distance of a memory  
  but instead something completely clear   
  as if it were only yesterday. 

## When you get the message, hang up the phone.
