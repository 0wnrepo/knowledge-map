- [1953: dna âœ¨](https://my.mindnode.com/eHJR69Qvm1maxCdSvqv4ahhjJYETkJmdVasGaEyt)
	- short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that contains the genetic code of organisms, includes animals, plants, protists, archaea and bacteria, DNA is in each cell in the organism and tells cells what proteins to make

## [protein](https://my.mindnode.com/rK5HqsvLPJ7qih8EVE6ysKeE66WqDepH95K7VCAR)

long chain molecules built from small units known as amino acids, they are joined together with peptide bonds

## computational biology

## [life](https://my.mindnode.com/wXqgZ7BTL6aBAPssDhMFEGRM4qZySK92ovhTnCMQ)

- is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signalling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate  
- various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria  
- the criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as "living"  
- the current definition of life is that organisms maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce

- [artificial](https://my.mindnode.com/DwenCoEcVPRn7k1JeWtMdV4DAkn4yo5DDRDyqyzq)
  - examines systems related to natural life, its processes, and its evolution, through the use of simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry

- [abiogenesis](https://my.mindnode.com/sd4fQ7CxJm1yhY2ixe4C1pdx593yx7mPxxumR7WS)
  - is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds

- [evolution](https://my.mindnode.com/qs3qFmoJmkmpAwsMTvzsesiUQ69obUQ1TTqD5yyU)

## [death](https://my.mindnode.com/Cj66AzrSbndZy51Bwx7iDiBzs5sKDqPTNwLSh1XP)

is death a natural and inevitable process or a disease that can be cured

## [1981: stem cells](https://my.mindnode.com/uTp8eDZkLRH7k2avRjRp1bXwKxsZBJxWz1V1Kdha)

are cells of the body (somatic cells) which can divide and become differentiated

## [bioinformatics](https://my.mindnode.com/PyqCCGyEuAX6Xysyn2nDXpfRpKvFXNzGxvcQzfBP)

study of large amounts of biological information, mostly it focuses on molecules like DNA

## [biomimetics](https://my.mindnode.com/n9zWyiZ6wbLFAry45xrBAqTq6FBuJUHjD9wGVBzs)

studying nature to create modern technology
