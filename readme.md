#GitHub is not all about code
##it's about sharing knowledge

I love making making notes on various things I learn. Mostly as a reference for
myself but I do try to keep it detailed so that anyone can get some value from
them.

Some of the notes I have are annotations over videos, I usually add a source of
what video it is, for these hyperlinks to work you will need to download the
pdfs locally.
