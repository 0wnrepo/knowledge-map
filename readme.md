# Why? üéà

[I wrote an article on why I made this and what the future of this project is](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/knowledge-bootstrapping-36c97e0dee19#.lehca4z09). In short, mind maps are an incredibly effective way to make the connections between different areas in whatever I am trying to research and learn. I just want to share this knowledge. [I also use Anki to retain it all in memory](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/tree/master/anki). [Contributions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#contributing-) are most welcome. Let's do this together.

The end goal is to visualise all the different paths one can take in exploring this world and see how all these paths connect as well as to provide the best resources on how to go about acquiring the knowledge needed to follow any of the paths. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) is a talk I really love on what research really means and how you can conduct it efficiently. [Transcript of it](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/%7Erobins/YouAndYourResearch.html).


# Where to start? ü§î

It depends on what you are looking for and what your goals are. I would suggest to just wait until [the main mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/83qmKgoATj8TyKzprzsPfoirxa2g9WmFGx3xpr1J) loads and explore visually. 

‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è 

- it takes ~ 1 minute to load
- does not load on mobile 
- small mind maps in [index](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#index-%EF%B8%8F) load instantly

Scroll around, look at the notes and click on the nodes. Each node is a topic of its own and often has really great resources linked to it for further study. Just look into what you think is interesting and go from there. 

The big branch of nodes you see on the right are books, some are free, some are not. The ones that are free have 'free: ' as a note added to them and will have a link to the book. Ones I have read already will have my notes and observations. The other big branch on the left are different humans of this world whose work I found interesting. Each node has a small description of what achievements and inventions he or she contributed to our planet. 

I do advise you to read the [key üîë](https://my.mindnode.com/Bd58ktc865sQoUvu6VyFYzYun87VmKseGhKNxp4q) as I try to cover any confusions one might have in navigating these mind maps there.

If you have expolored the interactive mind map a bit and are somewhat familiar with what is in it. There are two options you can take to quickly find the the appropriate mind map you may need. 

1. You can come on this page and just search for what you want in the [index](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#mindmap-index-%EF%B8%8F) and open the mind map from there. 

2. Or you can download an [alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map) which would allow you to instantly search and open the mind map you need from wherever you are.

These mind maps are a work in progress as I experiment in keeping my 'bookmark manager' and 'notebook' open and free in this way.

## [My Personal Articles üìñ](https://my.mindnode.com/aMjDG6PmWaH8zKmTmxoTzLvXSgysdi1nBiRYuVnd)
I love writing. I find the act of writing really enjoyable as I try to condense information in a way that another person can understand. 

## [My GitHup Repositories üëæ](https://my.mindnode.com/CEAz1uZBt1erP7sL7QXmACp9MktpSTjBseqmghXx#-472.9,-1307.6,2)

I really love programming, building and sharing the things I have built. Aside from this I am currently working on a [macOS app](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/last-time) to track events that I have done. 

## Contributing üéâ

There are few ways in which you can contribute. 

1. Nearly all nodes in the mind map have the best resources I could find on learning the topic. The internet is a big place though, if you found something interesting and valuable that is not there, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/issues/new) and say where and what you wish was added like in example [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/1).

2. If you think there is something interesting that I have missed completely to add in the main mind map, I am really curious to hear what it is. Please [say it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/issues/new). 

3. I am also providing descriptions to each of the nodes in the main mind map as can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#index-%EF%B8%8F). If you think that something is wrong or perhaps it can be said better, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/issues/new) and say it. The index is auto generated by the app thus pull requests are not possible.

# Future üöÄ

I want to develop a [web interface search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) for these mind maps and [create visualisations in code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-code) for each of the topics. 

I also believe the user experience of using the web version of mind maps will improve greatly in the coming months and I hope the [main mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/83qmKgoATj8TyKzprzsPfoirxa2g9WmFGx3xpr1J) will load in under 3 seconds with scrolling through it being as smooth as scrolling through a web page.

If you really love these ideas and find them  interesting, please [message me](mailto:nikita.voloboev@gmail.com) and I would love to hear your thoughts. I would love to work together to make this vision become a reality.

## [analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/hFFf6sxr9c8D7wxLU8tjQ6dBdx68nJuYu1MsSbEB)

- analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of resources (such as time and storage) necessary to execute them  
- most algorithms are designed to work with inputs of arbitrary length   
- usually, the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps (time complexity) or storage locations (space complexity)  
- it is common to estimate the complexity in the asymptotic sense   
	- i. e. estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input

### [time](https://my.mindnode.com/py9p3zQvDjNJJR8e7LQvufFhuCNSQdbGxz9CCabE)

- time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the string representing the input  
- it is commonly expressed using big O notation, which excludes coefficients and lower order terms  
- it is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, where an elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform

### [space](https://my.mindnode.com/ifCnybuRTbNpqeupsHU9swWpW6qgpe3wmK2G2grT)

- most used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order  
- efficient sorting is important for optimising the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists  
- it is also often useful for canonicalising data and for producing human readable output

## [graph ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/jtV98ApdqAA8RcaDwxrJRUyxTK6dyLxiL7xtkNey)

- they can be classified based on their mechanism of searching

### [combinatorial](https://my.mindnode.com/GdcdQx9B5K7gqAUvyMppTCfJ9YuNc5u66Sxwmijp)

- combinatorial search usually exploits one or more pruning strategies to avoid testing all of the possible candidate solutions  
- an example of combinatorial search is, for instance, branch and bound  
	- here, you may safely skip some subtrees since, depending on your particular optimisation problem, you know in advance that no node within a certain subtree can yield a better solution than the current one during the execution of your algorithm

	- a data structure is a concrete implementation of the specification provided by an ADT  
- are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place ints its memory, specified by a pointer (a bit string, representing a memory address), that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program  
- implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure

### [reinforcement learning](https://my.mindnode.com/twQ6Ft6P3rVHo1UxHwcmnx2GJQG9U7d6EgUTcKn8)

- inspired by behaviourist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward  
- in machine learning, the environment is typically formulated as Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilise dynamic programming techniques  
	- main differences between classical techniques and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not need knowledge about the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible  
- it differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected  
- basic reinforcement learning model consists of :  
	1. a set of environment and agent states S  
	2. a set of actions A of the agent  
	3. policies of transitioning from states to actions  
	4. rules that determine the scalar immediate reward of a transition  
	5. rules that describe what the agent observes

- most common a data set corresponds to the contents of a single database table, or a single statical data matrix, where every column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question

### [neural networks](https://my.mindnode.com/zLYtEZppgWfinP4p8S9LkxZsVB9kKfb38uhrXKct)

- are computational models based on a large collection of simple neural units (artificial neurons), loosely analogous to the observed behaviour of a biological brain‚Äôs axons  
- each neural unit is connected with many others, and links can enhance or inhibit the activation state of adjoining neural units  
- each individual neural unit computes using summation function  
- there may be a threshold function or limiting function on each connection and on the unit itself, such that the signal must surpass the limit before propagating to there neurons  
- these systems are self learning and trained, rather than explicitly programmed, and excel in areas where the solution or feature detection is difficult to express in a traditional computer program

## [deep learning ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/ycU59gAXTjsXkJqjR2xAYawvcFuXqUPbxiDpBX4z)

- is a class of machine learning algorithms that :   
	- use a cascade of many layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation  
		- each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input  
		- the algorithms may be supervised or unsupervised and applications include pattern analysis (unsupervised) and classification (supervised)  
	- are based on the (unsupervised) learning of multiple levels of features or representations of the data  
		- higher level features are derived from lower level features to form a hierarchical representation  
	- are part of the broader machine learning field of learning representations of data  
	- learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction (the levels form a hierarchy of concepts)

	- represent knowledge, including common sense knowledge  
	- plan  
	- learn  
	- communicate in natural language  
	- and integrate all these skills towards common goals

	- the higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur  
- probability theory is required to describe quantum phenomena

- [markov chains](https://my.mindnode.com/e3Hjd7WSfzApQaKjS13xx2iE1GHsgqniAaNgqscb)
  - are stochastic processes that satisfy the Markov property (sometimes characterised as ‚Äòmemorylessness‚Äô)  
  - a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process‚Äôs full history, hence independently from such history (i.e. conditional on the present state of the system, its future and paste states are independent)  
  - a Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either discrete state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies  
    
    
    
  is a model of some random process that happens over time, they are called this way because they follow a rule called the Markov property which states that whatever happens next in a process only depends on how it is right now (the state)

### [survival analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/k8JiQykg46ppxrzKhA6uoNtx3pZdkhMz7BL6gVaT)

### [time series analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/quKxxy1QV1osEUDTRJ3MS1ZAxPjxxkjqvQ8hPUaA)

- time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order, most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time, thus it is a sequence of discrete time data  
- examples of time series are heights of ocean tides and counts of sunspots  
- time series are very frequently plotted via line charts  
- time series analysis compromises methods for analysing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data

- is the process of deducing properties of an underlying distribution by analysis of data  
- inferential statistical analysis infers properties about a population (this includes testing hypotheses and deriving estimates)  
- it makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of sampling  
	- given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (firstly) selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data and (secondly) deducing propositions from the model  
- ‚Äòthe majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modelling‚Äô

- studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples (‚Äòmodels‚Äô) of algebraic structures  
	- for instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra on takes the ‚Äòtheory of groups‚Äô as an object of study  
- in universal algebra, an algebra (or algebraic structure) is a set A together with a collection of operations on A

### [homomorphism ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/Ws5PJ3aSyH7BcyKfkJdsefcxHcQ91sVBe3Lse4pw)

- is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces)  
- homomorphisms of vector spaces are also called linear maps  
- the concept of homomorphism has been generalised, under the name of morphism, to many other structures that either do not have an underlying set, or are not algebraic  
	- this generalisation is the starting point in category theory  
- being an isomorphism, an automorphism, or an endomorphism is a priority of some homomorphisms which may be defined in a way that may be generalised to any class of morphisms

### elementary

- considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering  
- differed from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values

## [calculus ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/aRxaYgpsEdv7zBzcsqTPhZ8C4CJ8VzcPGHUGFCwF)

- differential and integral calculus are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration

### [differential](https://my.mindnode.com/euvusRrywcxqy32QHBFDhARe17ZqadGnQLBNnDvK)

- is concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change  
- the primary objects of study in it are the derivative of a function, related notions such as the differentia, and their applications  
- the derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value  
	- the process of finding a derivative is called differentiation  
- geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point  
- for a real-valued function of a single real variable, the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best linear approximation to the function at that point  
- differentiation has applications to nearly all quantitative disciplines  
- derivates are frequently used to find the maxima and minima of a function

- is the extension of calculus in one variable to calculus with functions of several variables  
	- the differentiation and integration of functions involving multiple variables, rather than just one  
- a study of limits and continuity yields many counter-intuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions  
	- for example, there are scalar functions of two variables with points in their domain which give a particular limit when approached along any arbitrary line, yet give a different limit when approached along a parabola  
- a partial derivative of a multivariable function is a derivative with respect to one variable with all other variables held constant

## [discrete](https://my.mindnode.com/qAia4zcscPtDYjpE6YSHdC5uCzayQGgA3qz87zqm)

- is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous  
- in contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying ‚Äòsmoothly‚Äô, the objects studied in discrete math - such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic - do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values  
- discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers  
- more formally, discrete mathematics deals with countable sets (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers)  
- the set of objects studied in discrete math can be finite and infinite

  - matroids have found applications in geometry, topology, combinatorial optimisation, network theory and coding theory

## [logic](https://my.mindnode.com/mX9gF6Ud9LhaLfqLU6q4hWwtohuPvwEy2me9xF9E)

- is the systematic study of the form of arguments  
- a valid argument is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the argument and its conclusion   
- the validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content

### [combinatory](https://my.mindnode.com/L8qVAYGatTeXQDecPUr9y1E1Qy68GQ1pH4R8qp7L)

- is a notation to eliminate the need for quantified variables in mathematical logic  
- it is based on combinators   
	- which is a higher order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments  
- in computer science, combinatory logic is used as simplified model of computation, used in computability theory and proof theory

### [incompleteness ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/BtnMKNwKjPpzdi7ryZwE4DhhbAoLqSpzcUuxfy4v)

- Godel‚Äôs incompleteness theorems are two theories of mathematical logic that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system containing basic arithmetic  
- the theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert‚Äôs program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible  
- the first implemented theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems ca be listed by an effective procedure (i.e. an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers  
	- for any such formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system  
- the second theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency 

## [category theory ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/1ZNruQzLV5bsrLYhY6VgsydH1r29YS1XgmeLKPaa)

- formalises mathematical structure and its concepts in terms of a collection of objects and of arrows (also called morphisms)  
- a category has two basic properties  
	1. the ability to compose the arrows associatively   
	2. and the existence of an identity arrow for each object  
- the language of category theory has been used to formalise concepts of other high-level abstractions such as sets, rings and groups  
- in category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself  
- it has practical applications in programming language theory, in particular for the study of monads in functional programming

- it the foundational place in the discipline of mathematics  
- it studies prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g. rational numbers) or defined as generalisations of the integers (e.g. algebraic integers)  
- integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry)

### [primes ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/SzKTAzYHZy2PzyzDR5VfNWxQc3SFk2VYJG9qYTbq)

- are prime numbers greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself  
- a natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number  
	- for example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and and 6  
- any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering  
- the property of being prime is called primality  
- there are infinitely many primes

- is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing  
	- this can be studied by considering a collection of subsets, called open sets, that satisfy certain properties, turning the given set into what is known as a topological space  
	- important topological properties include connectedness and compactness  
- it developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension and transformation

### [pi ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/Zgz1zspR7f7ZzcMaK2ggg47wx2xqTQPzivxjkqRq)

- is a mathematical constant   
- it is the ratio of a circle‚Äôs circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159  
- being an irrational number, œÄ cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction  
- fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate œÄ  
- the digits appear to be randomly distributed  
- the digit sequence of œÄ is conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness, but to date no proof of this has been discovered  
- it is a transcendental number, i.e. a number that is not the root of any non-zero polynomial having rational coefficients   
	- this transcendence of œÄ implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge

### [euclidean space](https://my.mindnode.com/tMaqSbrRYryARN3Lbs1tQQCq4NzziiyvRqv5xp5b)

- encompasses the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry and certain other spaces  
- Euclidean spaces also generalise to higher dimensions  
- from modern viewpoint, there is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension  
- one way to think of the Euclidean plane is a set of points satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angle  
	- for example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as motions) on the plane  
	- one is translation, which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance  
	- the other is rotation about a fixed point in the plane, in which every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same angle  
- one of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered equivalent (congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections

### [projective](https://my.mindnode.com/ZRPCoypbzsosstWfitcTsu5UP6EznRstHcdzsyaC)

- is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations  
	- this means, that compared to elementary geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts  
- the bass intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called ‚Äòpoints at infinity‚Äô) to Euclidean points, and vice versa

### [coordinate system](https://my.mindnode.com/X4AdwT6PXGEGaHZMayNXzVsgcwbxabnUZqqUWcHc)

- is a system which uses one ore more numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of a point or there geometric element on a manifold such as Euclidean space  
- the order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a letter, as in ‚Äòthe x-coordinate‚Äô  
- the coordinates are taken to be real numbers in elementary mathematics, but may be complex numbers or elements of a more abstract system such as a commutative ring  
- the use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and vice verse (this is the basis of analytic geometry)

## [analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/6sxbuYZbQANpyrhCVnrcw8APN9eZdGzBV5yvqtAq)

- deals with limits and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series and analytic functions  
- these theories are usually studied in the context of real and complex numbers and functions

- study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext  
- it is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies  
	- there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language

### [functional analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/AH8GyeFxecym2PAH4qhdqfyyVenHcGcEjFQ5moir)

- the core of this study is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (e.g. inner product, norm, topology, etc.) and the linear functions defined on these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense

### [harmonic analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/ZsWX3PEy41PXKmnB8nsi2hzpvuYH85HZKgBxYMCs)

- is concerned with the representation of functions or signals as the superposition of basic waves, and the study of and generalisation of the notions of Fourier series and Fourier transforms (i.e. an extended form of Fourier analysis)

- is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions  
- it grew from the study of Fourier series which shows that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer  
- the decomposition process is called a Fourier transformation

### [numerical analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/gCqezFhjRQGcxfusZph2WMQstSCwWsJjqeNHxpPp)

- is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to general symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis 

### complex analysis

- investigates functions of complex numbers   
- as a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to the sum of its Taylor series (that is, it is analytic), complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable (that is, holomorphic functions)

### [fractional calculus](https://my.mindnode.com/xhT73BHjdEPwpgxhqexGBr1GhGFafrxzpqi9aBwp)

- studies the possibility of taking real number powers, real number fractional powers or complex numbers powers of the differentiation operator and the integration operator

- is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalising thinking, or the results of such thinking  
- they guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values  
- they are analytical tools for understanding, explaining and making predictions about a given subject matter

## [fractals ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/8suTHRqawXHqDPGAVYsxCAfbRQo6ZcGvCPvZ5vkp)

- is a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displayed at every scale  
- is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry  
- if the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern (i.e. Menger Sponge)  
	- fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels   
- they include the idea of a detailed pattern that repeats itself  
- they are different from other geometric figures because of the way in which they scale  
	- doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiples its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (here the dimension of the space the polygon resides in)  
	- likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight (to the power of its dimension)  
	- this power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal and it usually exceeds the fractal‚Äôs topological dimension  
- they are usually nowhere differentiable  
	- an infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line, still being a 1-dimensional line yet having a fractal dimension indication it also resembles a surface

## [decision theory](https://my.mindnode.com/KAHNnVQjfus3JW9pyTK3ESNu4qeCQqms2n3NsXex)

- is the study of reasoning underlying an agent‚Äôs choices  
- it can be broken into two branches   
	- normative (which gives advice on how to make the best decisions, given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of values)  
	- and descriptive (which analysis how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions)

### [markov decision processes](https://my.mindnode.com/zJ5EyXG2cvWCUYozwtKyn4gzhXtYCUyK6oMGvgXG)

- is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing the control flow

- [functional ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/VBKbwLewsn3MhqzDHunGu2GzKrU5apxicASUbHri)
  - is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data  
  - in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the argument that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time  
  - eliminating side effects (changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs), can make it much easier to understand and predict the behaviour of a program  
  - lambda calculus provides a theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluation

- logic
  - is largely based on formal logic  
  - any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain

- dataflow
  - models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing data flow principles and architecture

- constraint
  - is a paradigm wherein relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints  
  - constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found  
  - constrain programming can be expresses in the form of constrain logic programming, which embeds constrains into a logic program

### imperative

  - a feature of objects is that an object‚Äôs procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of ‚Äòthis‚Äô or ‚Äòself‚Äô)  
  - in OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another  
  - most popular object oriented languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their type

- procedural
  - is derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call  
  - procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computation steps to be carried out  
  - any given procedure might be called at any point during a program‚Äôs execution, including by other procedures or itself

### metaprogramming

- is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat programs as their data  
- it means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running  
- it can be used to move computations from run-time to compile-time, to generate code using compile time computations, and to enable self-modifying code

- [template metaprogramming](https://my.mindnode.com/GkpWKLpuRFrkF6zPEW92CzDtyaxua4s7YyAmZ4Kn)
  - is a metaprogramming technique in which templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code,, which is merged by the compiler to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled  
  - the output of these templates include compile-time constants, data structures and complete functions

## [exception handling ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/xEiGQnjcJeqyxvxpxspGJR7q4zDQPawRYMpJDqVj)

- exception handing is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions (anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing - often changing the normal flow of program execution)  
- in general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered exception handler

## [abstraction](https://my.mindnode.com/7aNxJDAnKfSqGHhHpnpewSeDdFMmCY5tj32fdFqH)

- is a technique for arranging complexity of computer systems  
- it works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, surpassing the more complex details below the current level  
- the programmer works with an idealised interface (usually well defined) and can add additional levels of functionality that would otherwise be too complex to handle  
- abstraction can apply to control or to data  
	- control abstraction is the abstraction of actions while data abstractions is that of data structures  
	- control abstraction involves the use of subroutines and control flow abstractions  
	- data abstraction allows handling pieces of data in meaningful ways  
- the notion of an object in object-oriented programming can be viewed as a way to combine abstractions of data and code

## [dependency injection](https://my.mindnode.com/L1ZfeUJUTiLaJG9RUbE47q6QkDkYUxBGMA9URp2E)

- is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object  
- a dependency is an object that can be used (a service)  
- an injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it  
	- the service is made part of the client‚Äôs state  
	- passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern  
- the intent behind it, is to decouple objects to the extent that no client code has to be changed simply because an object it depends on needs to be changed to a different one

## [syntax trees](https://my.mindnode.com/55ZLtTbzDZJV6aXqXUxN92g6Ps7GMbnsEpjD7sqq)

- is a set of rules that assign a property called a type to various contracts a computer program consists of, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules  
- the main purpose of it is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way  
	- this checking can happen   
		- statically (at compile time)  
		- dynamically (at run time)  
		- or as a combination of static and dynamic checking  
- other purposes of a type system include enabling certain compiler optimisations, allowing for multiple dispatch, providing a form of documentation, etc.

- is the decomposability property of a program, algorithm or problem into order-independent or partially-ordered components or units  
	- this means that even if the concurrent units of the program, algorithm, or problem are executed out-of-order or in partial order, the final outcome will remain the same  
	- this allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units  
- design of concurrent systems often entails finding reliable techniques for coordinating their execution, data exchange, memory allocation and execution scheduling to minimise response time and maxima throughput

- is a set of strings of symbols together with a set of rules that are specific to it  
- the alphabet of a formal language is the set of symbols, letters, or tokens from which the strings of the language may be formed  
	- the strings formed from this alphabet are called words, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed words or well-formed formulas  
- a formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, also called it formation rule


# [quantum computing](https://my.mindnode.com/MLQopPH5DasNfaHqszs2PMSk9Kp2qxxP3sLCiR29)

- studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data  
- they are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors   
	- whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states  
- a quantum turing machine is a theoretical model of such computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer

# [compilers ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/JxLJTw9UYqexCqyaqdKPxGGioWsDsWDmASWxpfsp)

- is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code  
	- is often done to create an executable program


## [JIT](https://my.mindnode.com/LgpsEFf3gzioSzG7bFNbMRcRMxQgjB8EtJDAD7u4)

- is compilation done during execution of a program (at run time), rather than prior to execution  
- mist often this consists of translation to machine code, which is then executed directly, but can also refer to translation to another format  
- a system implementing a JIT compiler typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation would outweigh the overhead of compiled that code  
- JIT compilation is a combination of two traditional approaches to translation to machine code  
	1. ahead of time compilation (AOT)  
	2. and interpretation

## [interpreter](https://my.mindnode.com/pezFduzLe1ot7ZKv5qckzijpwDQFDZrNs1cgjWhs)

- is a computer program that directly executes (performs) instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into machine language program  
- an interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution :   
	1. parse the source code and perform its behaviour directly (lisp, BASIC)  
	2. translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this (perl, python, ruby)  
	3. explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system (Pascal)  
- source programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as machine independent code, which is then linked at run-time and executed by an interpreter and/or compiler (for JIT systems)

## [bytecode](https://my.mindnode.com/RPbjdQipHWeALK23FTASbKF7ohxd7tNECm3Ntwkt)

- is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter  
- unlike human-readable source code, byte codes are compact numeric codes, constants and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and semantic analysis of things like type and nesting depths of program objects  
- they thus allow much better performance than interpreting source code directly  
- authors of V8 and Dart have challenged the notion that intermediate byte code is needed for fast and efficient VM implementation, both of these languages do direct JIT compiling from source code to machine code with no byte code intermediary

## [object code](https://my.mindnode.com/wNkD1fSF9u7EpYKpWDwSFzNSZfiLGSSuowQtsw7r)

- is what compiler produces   
- it is a sequence of statements or instructions in a computer language, usually machine code language (i.e. binary) or an intermediate language such as register transfer language (RTL)  
- object files can in turn be linked to form an executable file or library file  
	- in order to be used, object code must either be placed in an executable file, a library file, or an object file  
- object code is a portion of machine code that has not yet been linked into a complete program

## [machine code](https://my.mindnode.com/fixbcG2yGbd5D5Xqs6hXQeH9zGxZqHxaA7uHmfpq)

- is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer‚Äôs central processing unit (CPU)  
- each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory  
	- every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions

### [optimising compiler](https://my.mindnode.com/BgnCykCteFedakmQYGqqJnZS1SFufzAMUUrD6d5i)

- is a compiler that tries to minimise or maximise some attributes of an executable computer program  
- most common requirement is to minimise the time taken to execute a program, a less common one is to minimise the amount of memory required  
- it has been shown that some code optimisation problems are NP-complete, or even undecidable

## [LLVM ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/CVQ31TmsUVECWFwFLTRafvy1RbjTzP5E3gjBvs77)
