# [You can learn anything üìö](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/learn-anything-mindmaps)

The image above is an interactive mind map that can be [viewed and explored here](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#378.0,-582.0,1). 

When you click on any of the nodes in it, it will show you the best step by step guides you can use to learn the subject in depth. If you think that there is a better way one can learn the subject or you wish something was added, please [say it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#contributing-). üíô

# [Part of a bigger picture üó∫Ô∏è](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-smindmaps/)

Aside from these well curated mind maps on learning any topic on Earth. I also [try to visualise all of world's knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/mindmaps) and provide links to resources and articles relevant to each topic. It contains [all the interesting books you can read](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/mindmaps#books) where if a book is free, a link will be provided. All the topics one can research, all the interesting humans who ever lived, inventions, historical events, [interesting images](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/images#images-), everything. 

Eventually I want to make a visual mind map that all can explore.  

Until then, [here is the entire list of all 2500 mind maps for your viewing](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/mindmaps/). üìö

Unlike the [guided learning mind maps](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#378.0,-582.0,1), these ones follow a certain structure as I use them myself for my own research and comprehension as I [believe all knowledge should be free for all](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/knowledge-bootstrapping-36c97e0dee19). For example, [here](https://my.mindnode.com/zB6jcZpgGYqpGBfys7LXzBaej8qgUBwAo7kJssze#645.0,-1695.8,0) is a mind map for machine learning from this list. There are many like it in there, covering each subject.

To ease the process of trying to explore this big list of mind maps, I created [an interactive introduction](https://my.mindnode.com/Bd58ktc865sQoUvu6VyFYzYun87VmKseGhKNxp4q#-3839.8,-932.1,2) that you can take. 

If you want to help make this dream of visualising all of world's knowledge in this way a reality, [you can help in many ways](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#contributing-). üíô

As I learn more and more topics, I also make [flash cards](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/tree/master/anki) that I use to consolidate this knowledge.

## Contributing üéâ

There are many ways in which you can contribute and make these mind maps even more amazing.

### Help with Curated Study Guides üìö

1. Take a look at the [study plan](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/study-plan#study-plan-for-learning-anything). 

- Do you think some topic from it can be covered in a more efficient way? 
- Or perhaps something can be added to deepen the understanding of the topic? 
- Or the order with how material should be tackled should be different?
- Or you wish some other topic was covered that is not included?

Each topic from these mind maps has a [dedicated issue page](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astudy-plan). So if for example, you think that [computer science](https://my.mindnode.com/QKWtVCHyuwbZnuxdtzZhXxs4wp8St7GeiLbKMzQU#562.0,-83.9,2) mind map should use a different resource for learning the subject, you can [say it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/386). 

I use GitHub issues in a unique way where I just have an issue for all the suggestions one can possibly provide to improve this project. [Here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/labels) is a list of labels that are available. Or [you can make a search](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20mathematics%20) for what topic you want to contribute to.

### Help with visualising and sorting all of world's knowledge

1. Take a look at [this page](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-smindmaps/). Each mind map on the list should provide the best resources, articles, videos, talks, images and gifs that should help learn the topic well. 

All the nodes of this mind map should have the best resources one can get on learning the topic. The internet is a big place though, if you found something interesting and valuable that is not found in the mind maps, please [take a look at the issues page](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aresources) and add the resource to the appropriate issue. 

So if for exampe you found an amazing course on computer graphics, you would go [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/) and [make a search for 'courses'](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20course) like so : 

![](http://i.imgur.com/mnIQqTu.png)

and then say what course you wish was added in the appropriate issue :

![](http://i.imgur.com/VRGD844.png)


Aside from educational and learning material, resources you can add also include relevant articles, talks and videos appropriate to the topic. The focus is on quality of information rather than amount.

2. If you think there is something interesting that I have missed completely to add to the main mind map, [please say it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/359). 

3. I am also providing descriptions to each of the nodes in the main mind map as can be seen [here](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/mindmaps/). If you think that something is wrong or perhaps it can be said better, please [say it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/15). The index is auto generated by the app thus pull requests are not possible.

4. Found a mistake? Perhaps you think the way I have structured the nodes is wrong or it is better to move a node somewhere else? [Say it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/14). This mind map should represent knowledge visually in the most accurate and sensible way and I can't do it alone. 


## Fast searching üîé

I want to reduce the amount of time it takes to find the information you need, currently the two most optimal ways to open the mind map you are looking for are :

1. Bookmarking [the web page with list of all the mind maps](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/mindmaps/) and just searching for what you want there.

2. Or you can download an [alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map) which would allow you to instantly search and open the mind map you need from wherever you are. Requires macOS and [paid powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) for Alfred but I am looking to [expand it to more launchers](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map#contribute-) so it works on all operating systems.

# Future üöÄ

I want to develop a [web interface search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) for [these mind maps](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-smindmaps/) where users can search and be presented with an interactive mind map of links and resources instead of a static set of links.

I also want to [create visualisations in code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-code) for each of the topics as visualisians and playing around are the keys to understanding and comprehension. 

The end goal is to make an interactive mind map of all of world's knowledge that all can exlpore.

## [My Personal Articles üìñ](https://my.mindnode.com/aMjDG6PmWaH8zKmTmxoTzLvXSgysdi1nBiRYuVnd#212.1,-493.5,0)

I love writing. I find the act of writing really enjoyable as I try to condense information in a way that another person can understand. 

## [My GitHup Repositories üëæ](https://my.mindnode.com/47Fqmxya1dst3tfubcxAFoFmepQuxpsKCXPemds8#137.6,-889.4,0)

I really love programming, building and sharing the things I have built.
