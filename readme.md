# [You can learn anything üìö](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/learn-anything-mindmaps)

The image above is an interactive mind map that can be [viewed and explored here](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#378.0,-582.0,1). 

When you click on any of the nodes in it, it will show you the best step by step guides you can use to learn the subject in depth. If you think that there is a better way one can learn the subject or you wish something was added, please [say it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#contributing-). üíô

# [Part of a bigger picture üó∫Ô∏è](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-mindmaps/)

Aside from these well curated mind maps on learning any topic on Earth. I also [try to visualise all of world's knowledge](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-mindmaps/) and provide links to resources and articles relevant to each topic. It contains [all the interesting books you can read](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/all-mindmaps#books) where if a book is free, a link will be provided. All the topics one can research, all the interesting humans who ever lived, inventions, historical events, [interesting images](https://my.mindnode.com/mTasm9Ay8VtFs7fHRPDUSdEMqHExtjpcgwjBeUTC#-1595.7,-1760.0,-2), everything. 

Eventually I want to make a visual mind map that all can explore.  

Until then, [here is the entire list of all 2500 mind maps for your viewing](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-mindmaps/). üìö

Unlike the [guided learning mind maps](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#378.0,-582.0,1), these ones follow a certain structure as I use them myself for my own research and comprehension. I share them as [I believe all knowledge should be free for all](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/knowledge-bootstrapping-36c97e0dee19). For example, [here](https://my.mindnode.com/zB6jcZpgGYqpGBfys7LXzBaej8qgUBwAo7kJssze#645.0,-1695.8,0) is a mind map for machine learning from this list. There are many like it in there, covering each subject.

To ease the process of trying to explore this big list of mind maps, I created [an interactive introduction](https://my.mindnode.com/Bd58ktc865sQoUvu6VyFYzYun87VmKseGhKNxp4q#-3839.8,-932.1,2) that you can take. 

If you want to help make this dream of visualising all of world's knowledge in this way a reality, [you can help in many ways](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#contributing-). üíô

As I learn more and more topics, I also make [flash cards](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/tree/master/anki) that I use to consolidate this knowledge.

## Contributing üéâ

There are many ways in which you can contribute and make these mind maps even more amazing.

### Help with Curated Study Guides üìö

1. Take a look at the [study plan](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/learning-mindmaps). 

- Do you think some topic from it can be covered in a more efficient way? 
- Or perhaps something can be added to deepen the understanding of the topic? 
- Or the order with how material should be tackled should be different?
- Or you wish some other topic was covered that is not currently included?

Each topic from these mind maps has a [dedicated issue page](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astudy-plan). So if for example, you think that [computer science](https://my.mindnode.com/QKWtVCHyuwbZnuxdtzZhXxs4wp8St7GeiLbKMzQU#562.0,-83.9,2) mind map should use a different resource for learning the subject, you can [say it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/386). 

I use GitHub issues in a unique way where there isg an issue for all the suggestions one can possibly provide to improve this project. [Here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/labels) is a list of labels that are available. I mark issues that are in real need of contribution [as 'valuable'](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Avaluable). Please take a look and see how and where you can help. üíô

You can also [make a search](http://i.imgur.com/P1tceNE.png) for what topic you want to contribute to.

### Help with visualising and sorting all of world's knowledge üó∫Ô∏è

1. Take a look at [this page](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-mindmaps/). Each mind map on the list should provide the best resources, articles, videos, talks, images and gifs that should help learn the topic well. There are also [books](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/all-mindmaps#books), [courses](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/all-mindmaps#courses-), [influential humans](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/all-mindmaps#humans-), [inventions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/all-mindmaps#inventions) and more that you can help to expand. 

If you found something interesting related to any of the topics that you think is missing or perhaps you think there is an amazing book that all should read that is not already there or some person you admire or some topic of research that you think is not covered, please add it.

As above, most mind maps have a dedicated issue for them. So if for example you wanted to add a book, you would [add it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/24). If you want to add a topic that is not covered in any of the mind maps, you [can do it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/359). If you want to add a course, you can [do it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/10).

If you want to add any resources like learning material or articles or images, just search for what mind map you think they should be added in [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aresources).

I also curate [blogs](https://my.mindnode.com/Lr33AxQg1yTrPzYJrAbFD7E6Wr7cM6YyoUfXaEzp), [quora communities](https://my.mindnode.com/podGZSe7quPx5sFTPiEYugDpLBKVpVJsP9gPucdu), [reddit subreddits](https://my.mindnode.com/7GcutaqJUbnUuyjRsopqkPhyaaNa1BMmhao6pbf8), [quotes](https://my.mindnode.com/xenLnUXMQeADRoGCU9uCj5HgesBkbxvMzrLfU2pN), [advice](https://my.mindnode.com/mUBqDGqqUnz2up9oz3Q55NzAQfcc3tDER3vyH7XG), [interesting websites](https://my.mindnode.com/y4oVGAm2vzypkm3sxqzxVySu5VzN8bRhzRzPQeLs) and more.

Just add what you think is interesting and valuable and is appropriate to the topic. I cannot do this alone, but if we do it together, imagine what this could become. üåç


## Fast searching üîé

I want to reduce the amount of time it takes to find the information you need, currently the two most optimal ways to open the mind map you are looking for are :

1. Bookmarking [the web page with list of all the mind maps](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-mindmaps/) and just searching for what you want there.

2. Or you can download an [alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map) which would allow you to instantly search and open the mind map you need from wherever you are. Requires macOS and [paid powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) for Alfred but I am looking to [expand it to more launchers](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map#contribute-) so it works on all operating systems.

# Future üöÄ

I want to develop a [web interface search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) for [these mind maps](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-smindmaps/) where users can search and be presented with an interactive mind map of links and resources instead of a static set of links.

I also want to [create visualisations in code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-code) for each of the topics as visualisations and playing around are the keys to understanding and comprehension. 

The end goal is to make an interactive mind map of all of world's knowledge that all can exlpore.

## [My Personal Articles üìñ](https://my.mindnode.com/aMjDG6PmWaH8zKmTmxoTzLvXSgysdi1nBiRYuVnd#212.1,-493.5,0)

I love writing. I find the act of writing really enjoyable as I try to condense information in a way that another person can understand. 

## [My GitHup Repositories üëæ](https://my.mindnode.com/47Fqmxya1dst3tfubcxAFoFmepQuxpsKCXPemds8#137.6,-889.4,0)

I really love programming, building and sharing the things I have built.
