The image above is an [interactive mind map that can be viewed and explored](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#-48.5,-680.3,0). 

When you click on any of the nodes in it, it will show you the best step by step guides you can use to learn the subject in depth. 

There are many layers to this mind map and underlied nodes are hyperlinks. You may see emojis attached to some nodes. Here is what they mean : 

- üó∫ = it is another mind map
- üìù = it is a course
- üìñ = it is a free book
- üìï = it is not a free book (and you either have to search online or buy it)
- üëÄ = it is a video or a talk
- üñãÔ∏è = it is an article
- üåê = it is a wiki article
- üêô = it is a github page


If you think that there is a better way one can learn the subject or you wish something was added, [please say it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#contributing-). üíô

The arrows often represent relations. So if 'physics' has an arrow pointing to 'mathematics', it means that physics is related to it. Other times, arrows show direction and are used as a guide as can be seen [here](https://my.mindnode.com/zRGj6Bjd1T31sVhsJz4HcNbCCz7ZMgKNqJSWSjyt#392.4,-184.2,2).

The contents of the mind map can also be [viewed in text if you prefer that](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/study-plans) although they may not always be up-to-date.

# [Part of a bigger picture üó∫Ô∏è](https://my.mindnode.com/YyJtZap3S6BLzLq8FvBqcDM1fpzom5JfeXripa9w#34.7,-627.0,2)

In the mind map above, you will find a [little node](https://my.mindnode.com/YyJtZap3S6BLzLq8FvBqcDM1fpzom5JfeXripa9w#0.3,-513.6,2) named 'more' which acts as a gateway to all the research I do.

It contains :

- [all the interesting books you can read](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/books/) 
	- where if a book is free, a link will be provided
- [interesting courses one can take](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/courses/)
- [research papers on various topics](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/research-papers/)
- [interesting humans who ever lived](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/humans/)
- [inventions and historical events](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/history/)
- [interesting images](https://my.mindnode.com/mTasm9Ay8VtFs7fHRPDUSdEMqHExtjpcgwjBeUTC#108.8,-1795.2,-2)
- [interesting websites](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/websites/)
- and [more](https://my.mindnode.com/YyJtZap3S6BLzLq8FvBqcDM1fpzom5JfeXripa9w#0.3,-513.6,2) 

I also plan on creating a [search engine for all these mind maps](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine).  

If you want to help make this dream of visualising all of world's knowledge in this way a reality, [you can help in many ways](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#contributing-). üíô

As I learn more and more topics, I also make [flash cards](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/tree/master/anki) that I use to consolidate this knowledge.

## Contributing üéâ

There are many ways in which you can contribute and make these mind maps even more amazing.

### Help with Curated Study Guides üìö

1. Take some time to explore [the mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#-48.5,-680.3,0) or look at the study plans [in text](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/study-plans).

- Do you think some topic from it can be covered in a more efficient way? 
- Or perhaps something can be added to deepen the understanding of the topic? 
- Or the order with how material should be tackled should be different?
- Or you wish some other topic was covered that is not currently included?

There are 43 nodes in the [main mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#-48.5,-680.3,0), each representing a topic of research. 

Each topic has a [dedicated issue page](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22main+study+plan%22) which you can help improve. 

If for example, you think that [computer science mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/QKWtVCHyuwbZnuxdtzZhXxs4wp8St7GeiLbKMzQU#680.4,-273.5,2) should use a different resource for learning the subject, you can [say it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/430). 

Please take a look and see how and where you can help. üíô

You can also [make a search](http://i.imgur.com/vLk6PaZ.png) for what topic you want to contribute to.

### Help with visualising and sorting all of world's knowledge üó∫Ô∏è

1. Take a look at [this mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/YyJtZap3S6BLzLq8FvBqcDM1fpzom5JfeXripa9w) or scroll though the mind maps in [here](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/all-mindmaps/).

Each mind map on the list should provide the best resources, articles, videos, talks, images and gifs that should help learn the topic well. Here are some mind maps that I wish would be improved further : 

- [books](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/books/)
- [courses](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/courses/)
- [influential humans](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/humans/)
- [inventions](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/history/)
- [research papers](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/research-papers/) 
- and more 

If you found something interesting related to any of the topics that you think is missing or perhaps you think there is an amazing book that all should read that is not already there or some person you admire or some topic of research that you think is not covered, please add it.

As above, most mind maps have a dedicated issue for them. So if for example you wanted to add a book, you would [add it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/24). If you want to add a topic that is not covered in any of the mind maps, you [can do it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/359). If you want to add a course, you can [do it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/10).

If you want to add any resources like learning material or articles or images, just search for what mind map you think they should be added in [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aresources).

I also curate 

- [quora communities](https://my.mindnode.com/podGZSe7quPx5sFTPiEYugDpLBKVpVJsP9gPucdu#1629.3,547.0,2)
- [reddit subreddits](https://my.mindnode.com/7GcutaqJUbnUuyjRsopqkPhyaaNa1BMmhao6pbf8#61.2,-463.6,2)
- [quotes](https://my.mindnode.com/xenLnUXMQeADRoGCU9uCj5HgesBkbxvMzrLfU2pN#-5579.7,-1170.2,4)
- [advice](https://my.mindnode.com/mUBqDGqqUnz2up9oz3Q55NzAQfcc3tDER3vyH7XG#-938.8,-3010.0,3)
- [interesting websites](https://my.mindnode.com/y4oVGAm2vzypkm3sxqzxVySu5VzN8bRhzRzPQeLs#1370.4,-1428.7,2)
- and more

Just add what you think is interesting and valuable and is appropriate to the topic. I cannot do this alone, but if we do it together, imagine what this could become. üåç


## Fast searching üîé

I want to reduce the amount of time it takes to find the information you need. Before [the search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) is complete and working, the fastest ways you can get to the mind map that you want are

1. Bookmarking [this page](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map) or [or the mind map itself](http://bit.ly/learning-mindmaps). It takes ~ 2 sec to open it. Everything is structured well so there should be no problem of finding what you are looking for.

1. If you want to quickly find a book to read or a course to take or find a research paper you can read on some topic, [this list](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map#part-of-a-bigger-picture-%EF%B8%8F) offers really fast rendered web pages you can use. Just open the one you need and search for a book/course there.

3. You can also download an [alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map) which would allow you to instantly search and open the mind map you need from wherever you are. It is currently the fastest way to get to the mind map you need but it requires macOS and [paid powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) for Alfred. However I am looking to [expand it to more launchers](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map#help-improve-and-extend-it-) so it works on all operating systems, if you want to add your own solution, [you can](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map#help-improve-and-extend-it-). üíô

# Future üöÄ

I want to develop a [web interface search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) for all these mind maps where users can search and be presented with an interactive mind map of links and resources instead of a static set of links. 

I also want to [create visualisations in code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-code) for each of the topics as visualisations and playing around are the keys to understanding and comprehension. 

The end goal is to make an interactive mind map of all of world's knowledge that all can exlpore.

## [My Personal Articles üìñ](https://my.mindnode.com/aMjDG6PmWaH8zKmTmxoTzLvXSgysdi1nBiRYuVnd#231.9,-490.8,0)

I love writing. I find the act of writing really enjoyable as I try to condense information in a way that another person can understand. 

## [My GitHup Repositories üëæ](https://my.mindnode.com/47Fqmxya1dst3tfubcxAFoFmepQuxpsKCXPemds8#-11.3,-979.7,1)

I really love programming, building and sharing the things I have built.
