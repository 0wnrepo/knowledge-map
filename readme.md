#GitHub is not all about code
##it's about sharing knowledge

I **love** making notes on various things I learn. Mostly as a reference for
myself but I do try to keep it detailed so that anyone can get some value from
them.

Most of the notes I make are [mindmaps](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-notes/tree/master/mindmaps). I [love mind mapping](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/mind-map-everything-d27670f70739) my knowledge as it is incredibly effective way to make the connections between different areas in whatever I am trying to researh and learn. 

I also write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev). [Here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-notes/tree/master/articles) you can take a full look at all the articles I have written indexed by tags with small descriptions of each article.
