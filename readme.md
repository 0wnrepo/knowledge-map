#GitHub is not all about code
##it's about sharing knowledge

I love making notes on various things I learn. Mostly as a reference for
myself but I do try to keep it detailed so that anyone can get some value from
them.

Some of the notes I have are annotations over videos, I usually add a source of
what video it is, for these hyperlinks to work you will need to download the
pdfs locally. 


Some of the notes are [mindmaps](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-notes/tree/master/mindmaps). I love mind mapping my knowledge as it is incredibly effective to make the connections between different areas in whatever you are trying to researh and learn. 


I also write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev). [Here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-notes/tree/master/articles) you can take a full look at all the articles I have written indexed by tags with small descriptions of each article.
